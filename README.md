# Encryptix Internship Projects

This repository contains all the tasks and mini-projects completed during my internship at Encryptix.
The projects are implemented in Python using various libraries, focusing on problem-solving, logic building, and hands-on experience with real-world applications.



# Projects Included
## Recommendation System
.A collaborative‑filtering recommender implemented in Python (using scikit‑surprise or similar) that models user–item interactions to predict missing ratings.
.Supports user‑based and item‑based similarity (cosine/Pearson), trains on historical data and evaluates with metrics like RMSE.
.Generates top‑N recommendations per user and exposes a simple pipeline for loading datasets, training, and predicting.
.Designed modularly so you can swap datasets, similarity measures, or algorithms without rewriting the flow.

## Chatbot
.A lightweight conversational agent built with Python NLP libraries (e.g., NLTK/spaCy) that performs input cleaning, tokenization, and intent/keyword matching.
.Uses rule‑based and/or retrieval logic to map user queries to responses, with fallback handling for unknown inputs.
.Supports basic context tracking for short dialogs and is structured so you can plug in embeddings or an ML model later.
.Great for learning text preprocessing, simple dialog flow, and modular design for future upgrades.

## Tic Tac Toe
.A terminal‑based Tic‑Tac‑Toe game in pure Python with a readable board display, input validation, and a turn‑based game loop.
.Includes win/draw detection and move history, with an optional single‑player mode that uses a basic strategy or Minimax for AI play.
.Emphasizes clean, testable game logic and user prompts for a smooth CLI experience.
.Excellent practice for control flow, lists/tuples, and basic algorithmic thinking.
